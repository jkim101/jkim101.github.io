**Deaconess Kyung-hee**

It was a first,

Experiencing how deeply someone's death could pierce the soul.\
Throughout the funeral service, I struggled mightily\
Not to recall the times we shared.\
Though I failed in this endeavor.

Those fifteen years or so with her.

In every significant moment of life\
Over the past fifteen years,\
She was always there.

The one who served warm noodles to me, alone in a foreign land.\
The one who offered the brightest congratulations when I decided to marry.\
The one who taught us, full of mistakes, how to shop at the market and cut food.\
The one who brought warm seaweed soup for our new life, when we had nothing.\
The one who listened when I pondered whether to stay or return.\
The one who rejoiced most when my first job was secured and I decided to stay.\
The one who smiled nightly, replaying videos of my daughter.\
The one who silently listened to my struggles with faith and relationships.\
The one who was like a gentle breeze, soothing my fragile, sometimes broken heart.

It was her.

Even while battling a terrible illness, she was always warm when calling my name.

Though I believe she's now in a beautiful place, in beautiful company, at a beautiful time,\
I still can't believe the reality that she's no longer by my side.

Farewell, Deaconess. See you again.
