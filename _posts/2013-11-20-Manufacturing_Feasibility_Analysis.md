Manufacturing Feasibility Analysis
Manufacturing feasibility analysis answers the question "can you build it?"  It is directed toward evaluation of the compatibility of the demands of the manufacturing task and the manufacturing environment (5Ms) required to accomplish it. The capability of a contractor (or manufacturing source) to successfully execute the manufacturing effort depends upon that contractor having:

> An understanding of the manufacturing task; 
Adequate qualitative production skills;
Sufficient personnel (on hand or available);
Sufficient facility floor space;
Equipment in satisfactory condition;
Adequate, operable test equipment;
Assured, capable suppliers;
Management capability; and
A plan to coordinate all resources.


Manufacturing feasibility is first addressed in the Assessment of Alternatives (AoA).  The assessment determines the likelihood that a system design concept can be produced using existing manufacturing technologies and capabilities while simultaneously meeting quality, production rate and cost requirements.

Feasibility is a bounded issue. It is bounded by existing manufacturing technology. There is a presumption that the state of current manufacturing technology relative to the system concept can be defined. There is also a presumption that the system concept will have sufficient definition to determine the technology demands embedded in it. Having determined the state of technology and the system demands, questions such as those which follow should be raised. What is the likelihood that the manufacturing task can be accomplished given your knowledge of the design and given your knowledge of the production environment in existence today? Based upon the feasibility assessment, the PMO should develop a manufacturing risk evaluation to quantify the statement of manufacturing feasibility.  What is the risk level and where are those risks? A major result of the feasibility evaluation is the identification of manufacturing technology needs. The purpose of this identification is to determine which planned or ongoing manufacturing technology programs are required to achieve production phase objectives, priority can then be given to these programs to ensure that necessary capabilities can be put on line in the factory and be proven prior to the production phase.

The feasibility analysis also provides a basis for manufacturing planning because its accomplishment involves the evaluation of:

Producibility;
Critical manufacturing processes;
Special tooling requirements;
Test and demonstration requirements for new materials and processes;
Alternate design approaches; and
Anticipated manufacturing risks and potential cost and schedule impacts.
